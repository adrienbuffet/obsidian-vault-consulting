# Welcome !

This Obsidian vault is dedicated to all people who regularly carry out projects with several clients and wish to keep notes of the many adjoining meetings.

This vault is a construction of all the practices that I use on a daily basis for more than three months to manage my notes. It does not aim to present all the features of Obsidian, just to be a fast, useful and flexible way to organise your meeting notes.
